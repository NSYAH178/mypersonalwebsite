This opportunity is very meaningful for me because it can be a very calm and extraordinary experience. My first feeling of seeing the Qibla of the Muslims, the Kaaba, seemed to disbelieve that it was already in front of my eyes. I learned a lot when I was there for 2 weeks. I learned the way of life of the Arabs and the different races there. Taste the delicious food and visit the historic place. One day, my dream is to bring all my family members together to perform Hajj or Umrah. InshaAllah.</font></p>
